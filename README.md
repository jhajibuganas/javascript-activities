# Javascript Crash Course

This is my Javascript crash course activities.

Activity 1:
Create 1 html page that have the following:

1. 2 input box
2. 1 button
3. If the user click the button it calculate the numbers inputted in the 2 input box

Activity 2 & 3:

1. Create a page where all the information in the json will be displayed.
2. NOTE: - Use javascript to loop the json data - define/put the json data inside a .js file.

Activity 4:
Using ajax call, display the results of this API: https://phisix-api4.appspot.com/stocks.json
Note: Don't put the values of this API to your code - the idea is, call the API and assign the results to a variable then traverse/loop on that variable to display each data.
Reference material: - https://levelup.gitconnected.com/all-possible-ways-of-making-an-api-call-in-plain-javascript-c0dee3c11b8b
Fro the reference material they have different ways to call the API.
You can try all but the requirements is to number 3.

1. XMLHttpRequest
2. fetch
3. Axios
4. jQuery
